# Dawn Construction â€” High-Fidelity Render (Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion)

This is a **presentation-ready marketing render** (no CMS/backend) to wow stakeholders with visuals, motion, and structure.

## Tech
- Next.js (App Router, TS)
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- Remote images from Unsplash, background video from Pexels

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- Images are remote; internet is required at runtime.
- You can replace the hero video URL in `components/Hero.tsx` with a company reel when provided.
- For production, add analytics, SEO tags, and actual content; this repo focuses on **look & feel**.
